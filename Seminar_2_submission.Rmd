## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# My Seminar Submission

Complete the following:


> 1.  Write your name and surname in bold font, with your Name ONLY in
>     italics.

**Answer**

**_Jakub_ Fridrich**

> 2.  Print your student number and what year you are in on different
>     lines.

**Answer**

```{r}
print(2001497)
print('Year 4')
```



> 3.  Briefly state, in italics, why you are doing this Data Science
>     Module

**Answer**

*I am doing this module to strengthen my application to a Data Science masters*

> 4.  Make an unordered list of at least 3 things you have learned in
>     this module.

**Answer**

<!-- Not sure if you wanted code or not so here are both my answers: -->

- The CRISP-DM methodology

- That R has variable types like factor which are not present in Python

- The importance of data pre-processing

> 5.  Create a table showing the 1st 5 stages of the John Rollins
>     General Data Science Methodology and the quetions associate with
>     them.

**Answer**

```{r}
my_table <- data.frame(
  stage_1 = c("Business/Problem Understanding", "What problem are you trying to solve?"), 
  stage_2 = c("Analytic Apprach", "How can you use the data to answer this question?"), 
  stage_3 = c("Data requirements", "What data is needed to answer the question?"), 
  stage_4 = c("Data collection", "What is the source of this data? How to collect?"), 
  stage_5 = c("Data Understanding", "Is the data indicative of the problem to be solved?")
)

library(knitr)
kable(my_table)
```



> 6.  Create an ordered list of at least 3 other Data Science
>     methodologies.

**Answer**

1. Crisp-DM
2. TDSP
3. OSEMN

> 7.  Provide and ordered list the weaknesses of the CRISP-DM
>     methodology and how to address them

**Answer**


#### Weaknesses

1. Outdated
2. Documnetation heavy
3. Not a project managment approach
4. Can ignore stake holders
5. Slow start

#### Combatting these

1. Defining team roles
2. Combining with a team coordiantion process
3. Document enough, but not too much
4. Iterate quickly
5. Ensrure actionable insight
6. Add phases (if needed)

> 8.  Download and include a University of Warwick Logo in your
>     document.

**Answer**

> 9.  Write and execute a code to randomly generate 10 numbers from a
>     normal distribution with mean 12 and standard deviation 3.

**Answer**

```{r}
set.seed(123)
random_numbers <- rnorm(10, mean = 12, sd = 3)
print(random_numbers)
```


> 10. Write and execute a code to calculate the mean of 12 random
>     numbers generated from the intervalof integes from 5 to 25.

**Answer**


```{r}
set.seed(123)
random_numbers_2 <- sample(5:25, 12, replace = TRUE)
mean_value <- mean(random_numbers_2)
print(mean_value)
```

> 11. Write and execute a code to create a scatter plot containing 12
>     points whose coordinates were randomly geenrated in the interval 5
>     to 25. Provide a title for the figure, label the x and y axis.

**Answer**

```{r}
set.seed(123)
random_x_values = sample(5:25, 12, replace = TRUE)
random_y_values = sample(5:25, 12, replace = TRUE)
data <- data.frame(x = random_x_values, y = random_y_values)

library(ggplot2)
scatter_plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot with Random Coordinates",
       x = "X-Axis",
       y = "Y-Axis")

print(scatter_plot)
```


> 12. Write and execute a code to create a function to calculate
>     standard error. Then, calculate the standard error of a set of 15
>     randomly generated numbers from a normal distribution with mean 12
>     and standard deviation 3.

**Answer**

```{r}
standard_error <- function(data) 
  {se <- sd(data)/sqrt(length(data))
return(se)}

set.seed(123)
random_numbers_3 <- rnorm(15, mean = 12, sd = 3)
print(standard_error(random_numbers_3))
```


> 13. Given that BMI=kg/m2, where kg is the personâ€™s weight in kilograms
>     and m2is height in meters squared, write and execute a code to
>     create a function that calculates the BMI of who weighs 85kg and
>     is 1.9m tall.

**Answer**

```{r}
bmi <- function(weight_kg, height_m) 
{bmi_inner <- weight_kg/height_m**2
  return(bmi_inner)}

print(bmi(85,1.9))

```
